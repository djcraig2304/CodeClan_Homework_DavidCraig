## Linear Regression Model Steps

1. Data Wrangling/ Cleaning 
2. Exploratory data analysis 
3. Define outcome variable and input variables for linear models
4. 
- Use ggpairs to look at correlations and associations between all variables, 
not just output variables. If variables are highly correlated ie greater than 0.6
then you can drop one of the variables and keep the other. 
- Use alias() to look for related variables. 
- write out highest correlated variables with outcome variables as best candidates. 

5. Start to build candidate linear models and compare between each.
after each model is completed make residual ggpairs plots, add_residuals() function, 
to see if future additions of variabes correlate with residuals.

6. continue to build models and check rsq values and signifcance to determine the effect
of adding variables to the models.
