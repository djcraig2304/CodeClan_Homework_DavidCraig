```{r}

drinks_content

```

## Question 1

```{r}
dim(drinks_content)
#dimensions
```
```{r}
nrow(drinks_content)
#row number

```
```{r}
ncol(drinks_content)
#column number
```
```{r}
summary(drinks_content)
#variable types and variable names
```

```{r}
names(drinks_content)
#variable names
```

```{r}
head(drinks_content)
#top 6 rows

```


```{r}
tail(drinks_content)
#bottom 6 rows
```
```{r}
glimpse(drinks_content)
#data snapshot

```
```{r}
skim(drinks_content)
#skimr view of dataset
```


## Question 2:

```{r}
(drinks_content, Beverage_category:Calories) 
#selected columns, No NA values were detected in Calories column

```

```{r}
drink_calories <- select(drinks_content, Beverage_category:Calories)
filter(drink_calories, Calories == NA)
# No NA values were detected in Calories column

```


## Question 3

```{r}
drink_calories %>% 
  mutate(calorie_diff = Calories - 135)
#added new column with calorie differences
```


## Question 4
```{r}
drink_calories %>% 
  group_by(Beverage_category) %>% 
  summarise(mean(Calories), median(Calories))
# The 3 highest calorie drinks in descending order are Smoothies, FrappuccinoÂ® Blended Coffee and Signature Espresso Drinks.
# The 3 lowest calorie drinks in ascending order are Coffee, Shaken Iced Beverages and Classic Espresso Drinks.
```

## Question 5

```{r}
drink_calories %>% 
  group_by(Beverage_prep) %>% 
  summarise(mean(Calories))
#The average number of calories by beverage prep type.
```

## Question 6

```{r}
drink_calories %>% 
  summarise(mean(Calories)) %>% 
  pull()
## extracted the average value for all drinks from the data 

```
```{r}
all_drinks_av <- drink_calories %>% 
  summarise(mean(Calories)) %>% 
  pull()

all_drinks_av
```
```{r}
drink_calories %>% 
  group_by(Beverage_prep) %>% 
  summarise(mean(Calories) - all_drinks_av)
# 2% Milk, Grande Nonfat Milk, Soymilk contain more than the average calories of all drinks.
```

##Question 7

```{r}
drink_calories %>% 
  arrange(desc(Calories)) %>% 
  tail(15)
# The best low calorie coffee drink is a short brewed coffee. Below is a table of the 15 lowest calorie drinks.
